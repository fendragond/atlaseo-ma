| **Cursor** | AI code generation and maintenance |
| **Claude Pro** | Strategy, content, SEO, briefs, problem solving |
| **Stitch** | Design mockups |

---

## 2. Infrastructure Decisions

### Cloudflare
- Cloudflare Pages is **deprecated** — do not use for new projects
- All new sites use **Workers Static Assets** (Wrangler v4+)
- One Worker = one client site
- `wrangler.toml` (or `wrangler.jsonc`) per project handles static assets + any dynamic routes
- No database needed for current scope

### Contact / CTA Strategy (per client)
- **Option A** — Pure static: WhatsApp link, click-to-call, mailto, socials. Zero backend. Default for simple clients.
- **Option B** — Worker contact form: POST request → validate → send email via Resend/MailChannels. For corporate clients.
- **Option C** — Both: form + floating WhatsApp button. Best for Moroccan market conversion.
- Template ships with both patterns as toggleable components. Decided at project setup, not rebuild.

### Form-Backed Submissions (forms with attachments or sensitive data)

The default for client sites remains Option A (pure static + WhatsApp/mailto). When a project requires file uploads (CVs, documents) **or** the submission of personal data (job applications, leads with PII), the pattern is:

**Frontend form → Worker route (e.g. `/api/candidature`) → Resend API → recipient mailbox** with the uploaded file forwarded as an email attachment.

**Resend** is chosen over MailChannels for better developer experience, reliable deliverability, and a free tier sufficient for sub-3000 sends/month per client.

**Mandatory components for any such form:**
- Honeypot field (anti-spam, invisible to humans)
- Cloudflare rate limiting at the Worker level
- Explicit CNDP/RGPD consent checkbox, blocking submission if unchecked
- Server-side validation of file type (PDF/DOC/DOCX only by default) and size (max 5MB by default)

**Optional:** archive uploads to Cloudflare R2 if the client requests retention.

> **Status:** Principles validated. Implementation snippet, exact env vars, and concrete schema will be added to this subsection after the first production validation on the ODBM project.

### Staging URL pattern (pre-domain QA)

Every Cloudflare Worker exposes a permanent staging URL of the form `[project-name].fahd-d-d01.workers.dev`. This URL is the canonical staging environment used for: client QA, Lighthouse audits, screenshot capture, and any pre-launch verification.

**Critical implication:** a project can be fully built, QA'd, and validated by the client **before** the production domain is acquired or pointed. This decouples build velocity from domain acquisition delays (e.g. ANRT validation for `.ma` domains can take several weeks).

Once the production domain is configured, the staging URL remains active and can be used for future iterations and A/B testing.

### No Database
- Sites are content sites — no user data, no inventory, no real-time needs
- Content lives in Astro content collections (markdown files)
- Persistence needs (if ever): Cloudflare D1 or KV — not MongoDB
- Client blog editing: Decap CMS or TinaCMS (writes back to git, no DB)

---

## 3. SEO Technical Implementation

> **Strategic SEO decisions (local SEO priority, target audiences, content plan, GEO/AEO) are in `ATLASEO_strategy.md` §5.** This section covers only the technical implementation that's baked into every site template.

### Astro packages standard
- `astro-seo` — meta tags, canonical, OG tags per page
- `@astrojs/sitemap` — auto-generated sitemap
- Custom `SchemaOrg.astro` component for JSON-LD

### JSON-LD Schema components (reusable)
- `LocalBusiness` for doctors, lawyers, professionals with physical location
- `MedicalBusiness` for medical practices specifically (subtype of LocalBusiness)
- `Organization` for companies
- `FAQPage` for pages with structured Q&A sections
- `BreadcrumbList` for all internal pages
- `Service` for pricing/pack pages
- `Article` for blog posts

### Per-page SEO baseline
- Unique `<title>` ≤60 chars, keyword-rich
- Unique `<meta description>` ≤155 chars, include emoji ☎️ + phone number for CTR boost
- Self-referencing canonical tag matching the actual served URL exactly
- OG tags: `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:image`, `og:url`, `og:type`
- Meta robots: `index, follow` for content pages; `noindex` for legal pages and aggregator-only pages

### Standard files in every project
- `public/robots.txt` — allow all important pages
- `public/sitemap-index.xml` — only canonical content pages, no thank-you pages or thin content
- `src/components/seo/SchemaOrg.astro`
- `src/components/contact/` — WhatsApp + form variants

### Analytics standard
- GA4 + Cloudflare Web Analytics on every site
- Google Search Console setup within 24h of launch (non-negotiable)
- Track as GA4 conversions: contact form submissions, call clicks, WhatsApp clicks

### Mobile-first baseline (Morocco-specific)
- 85% of Moroccan web traffic is mobile — design and test mobile first
- LCP mobile target: <2.5s (preload hero image mandatory)
- Lighthouse mobile target: ≥90 on all 4 categories
- Lighthouse desktop target: ≥95 on all 4 categories

---

## 4. Workflow Model

### AI Cost Reduction Rule
> **Claude Pro = thinking. Cursor = typing.**

- Use Claude Pro for: strategy, content, French copy, SEO research, page structure, discovery questions, briefs
- Output one `brief.md` per project — Cursor works from this document
- Cursor never re-derives decisions already made in the brief
- Build prompt templates in Claude Pro Projects — one Project per client
- Starter template reduces Cursor usage ~60% vs building from scratch

### Cursor prompt conventions

- **Language:** all Cursor prompts are written in English, regardless of the editorial content language. French content goes inside the prompt as quoted strings or instructions.
- **Format:** prompts are formatted as **plain text inside a code block** (triple backticks with no language tag), never inside blockquotes — this ensures the copy button appears reliably in the Claude UI.
- **Intent-based:** prompts describe **what** to build and **why**, never **what code** to write. Cursor is the one writing code. Embedding actual code in a prompt defeats the workflow.
- **One concern per prompt:** prompts are split into logical chunks — one prompt equals one component, one page, or one feature. Avoid omnibus prompts that bundle unrelated concerns.
- **No git/deploy steps inside prompts:** git commit, push, build, and deploy are never inside Cursor prompts. They are separate manual actions performed by the founder after `npm run dev` validation passes.
- **Content production:** Claude generates final editorial content (copy, JSON, schema). Cursor only places it. This prevents Cursor from rewriting validated French copy into mediocre output.

### Per-Project Flow
1. **Discovery** — client questionnaire → define pages, CTAs, content needs, SEO targets
2. **Brief** — produce `<client>_brief.md` in Claude Pro (content, structure, SEO, component decisions)
3. **Build** — Cursor generates from brief using starter template
4. **SEO pass** — schema, meta, sitemap, GBP setup, Search Console
5. **Launch** — `wrangler deploy`, domain config in Cloudflare, submit to Google
6. **Handoff** — launch checklist, client doc, maintenance agreement

### Deployment Protocol (Workers Static Assets)

> Hard-won lesson from first Cloudflare deployment. Never skip the build step.

**The build/deploy distinction**
- `npm run dev` — local dev server only. Serves directly from `src/`. Changes appear instantly but this has nothing to do with production.
- `npm run build` — compiles everything into `dist/`. This is what Cloudflare gets.
- `npx wrangler deploy` — pushes `dist/` to Cloudflare Workers. Never skip the build before this.

**End-to-end commit/deploy sequence**

The canonical workflow from validated work to live production:

1. **Validate locally** — `npm run dev`, visual + functional check on `localhost:4321`
2. **Single commit** — one commit per page or feature unit (never one commit per micro-change)
3. **Push** — `git push` to `origin main`
4. **Build** — `npm run build` (compiles `src/` into `dist/`)
5. **Deploy** — `npx wrangler deploy` (pushes `dist/` to Cloudflare)

**Cross-reference with existing Windows/PowerShell notes:**
- All five steps run on **separate lines** — never chained with `&&`
- Use `2>$null` instead of `2>/dev/null` where redirection is needed
- Prefer `git add .` over individual path specification for staging

**Until the GitHub Action is set up post-domain, steps 4 and 5 are manual.** After the Action is configured, step 3 alone triggers steps 4 and 5 automatically on every push to `main`.

**Deployment process**

Pre-domain:
1. `npm run build`
2. `npx wrangler deploy`

After domain is configured:
- Set up a GitHub Action to auto-build and deploy on every push to `main`
- From that point: `git push` is enough

**Why this is different from previous projects**
- Cloudflare Pages (used in past projects) auto-builds on every git push — no manual step needed.
- Workers Static Assets (current setup) has no auto-deploy. Wrangler is a manual CLI tool.
- The VS Code three-icon push only does `git push` — Cloudflare never sees it.

**Windows / PowerShell notes**
- `&&` is not a valid command separator — run commands on separate lines
- `2>/dev/null` does not work — use `2>$null` instead
- `true` is not a built-in — use separate commands instead of chaining

## 5. Starter Template

### Philosophy
- ATLASEO.ma is **template v1** — every decision made there becomes the reusable starter
- After ATLASEO ships, repo is forked into `atlaseo-starter`
- Every new client = `git clone atlaseo-starter`, then Cursor only touches content + styling

### Standard Sections (components)
- Hero
- Services
- Process / How it works
- Portfolio / Case studies
- Testimonials
- About
- Blog (content collection)
- Contact (WhatsApp CTA and/or form — toggleable)
- Footer

### Standard Files
- `wrangler.jsonc` — Workers Static Assets config
- `astro.config.mjs` — with `@astrojs/sitemap`, `trailingSlash: 'never'`, `site: 'https://domain.ma'`
- `src/content/` — blog and services collections
- `src/components/seo/` — JSON-LD schema components
- `src/components/contact/` — WhatsApp + form variants
- `public/robots.txt`
- `PROCESS.md` — delivery checklist (see §7)
- `brief.md` — per-project content brief (not committed to starter)

### Reusable components inherited from atlaseo.ma

The atlaseo.ma build is the source for two production-tested components promoted to the starter:

**FAQ Accordion**
A pattern using JS toggle via `data-faq-item` and `data-faq-icon` attributes. Includes automatic `FAQPage` JSON-LD schema generation from the same source data. Arrow icon rotates 180° on open. Single-open or multi-open mode togglable via prop. Mobile-friendly tap targets.

**Sticky Mobile CTA Bar**
A fixed bottom bar visible only on mobile (`md:hidden`), scroll-triggered visibility (appears after 30% scroll, hides on scroll-up). Contains WhatsApp + primary CTA buttons side by side. Uses Tailwind `translate-y` utility classes for show/hide animation — no custom CSS conflict with Tailwind reset (lesson learned from atlaseo.ma debug session).

Both components are ready to be cloned into any new project. Client-specific copy, links, and color overrides are the only customization needed at instantiation.

**Components NOT promoted to the starter (remain atlaseo.ma-specific):**
- `CollaborationStepper` — too tied to ATLASEO's 3-pillar narrative
- Trust Strip card — too tied to the Dr Yousra cas client format

These can be re-promoted later if a second project genuinely needs them.

### Default design tokens (overridable per project)

The starter ships with a **Material Design 3 token system** in `tailwind.config.mjs` covering:
- **Surface scale** — `surface-container-lowest` through `surface-container-highest`
- **Color roles** — `primary`, `secondary`, `on-surface`, `on-surface-variant`
- **Outline scale** — `outline`, `outline-variant`
- **Semantic** — `error`, plus context-specific containers

**Convention:** the token **names** are constant across all projects (never renamed). The token **values** (actual hex colors) are project-specific and overridden per client based on brand, logo, and message.

**Same logic applies to typography:**
The starter ships with Hanken Grotesk (display) + Inter (body) + JetBrains Mono (labels), loaded via `@fontsource` self-hosting, as **default**. Per-project, this default can and should be reviewed and overridden when the client's brand requires a different visual register.

**Concrete example:** the ODBM project (BTP / construction sector) will likely move away from Hanken Grotesk's premium-tech feel toward a more industrial/architectural typeface like **IBM Plex Sans**, **Archivo**, or **Space Grotesk**, paired with a palette built around concrete grays, sand beige, and a safety-orange accent — radically different from ATLASEO's own navy/green identity.

**The starter does not impose visual identity. It imposes the token architecture.**

## 8. Indexation Protocol — Hard Rules

> This is a hard-won lesson from dryousra.ma (12/32 pages indexed, "Détectée — non indexée" on the rest). Every rule below is non-negotiable from day one. Fixing indexation post-launch is expensive in time and energy. Build it right once.

### Root causes of "Détectée — actuellement non indexée"
Google found the page but decided it wasn't worth indexing. This is a **quality/priority signal**, not a technical crawl block. Main causes:
- **Thin content** — page has too little text, too little value, or near-duplicate content across pages
- **Orphan pages** — page exists but no other page on the site links to it
- **Too many pages** — a showcase site with 30+ pages signals low average quality to Google; fewer, richer pages always wins
- **No external authority** — brand new domain with zero backlinks has low crawl priority, especially `.ma` TLDs
- **Redirect errors** — www/non-www inconsistency, HTTP/HTTPS mismatch, or redirect chains confuse Google

### Hard rules — baked into every site from day one

**Page count discipline**
- Landing page: 1–3 pages max
- Showcase site: 5–8 pages max (never exceed 10 without strong justification)
- Every page must justify its existence with unique, substantive content
- Never create a page that is essentially a duplicate of another with slightly different wording
- If content is thin, merge it into a richer parent page — don't publish it as a standalone

**Content minimums per page**
- Service/specialty page: 300 words minimum, 500+ preferred, 1500+ for SEO-aggressive pages
- About page: 200 words minimum with real, specific information (not filler)
- Homepage: meaningful copy, not just a hero image and a button
- Blog posts (if any): 600 words minimum — never publish below this threshold
- No AI-generated content without human review and enrichment — Google's May 2025 update actively deprioritizes mass AI content lacking E-E-A-T signals

**Internal linking — mandatory structure**
- Every page must be reachable within **2 clicks from the homepage**
- Every page must have **at least one internal link pointing to it** from another page
- No orphan pages — ever. Check before every deploy
- Use descriptive anchor text (e.g. "nos services de création de site web" not "cliquez ici")
- Footer must link to all main pages — this is the safety net for crawl discovery

**Technical — zero tolerance**
- Single canonical URL decided at project start: `domain.ma` (no www) or `www.domain.ma` — never both
- All internal links, sitemap URLs, and canonical tags must use this exact form — no exceptions
- `robots.txt` must allow all important pages — review before every launch
- Every page must have a self-referencing canonical tag (Astro SEO component handles this)
- No redirect chains — if A redirects to B, B must be the final URL, never redirect to C
- HTTP → HTTPS: enforced at Cloudflare level, all internal links already use HTTPS
- Trailing slash: pick one convention (`/about` or `/about/`) and enforce it everywhere in Astro config

**Sitemap discipline**
- Only submit pages that deserve to rank — never include thank-you pages, internal utilities, or thin content
- Sitemap must exactly match canonical URLs (same protocol, same www/non-www, same trailing slash)
- Submit sitemap to Google Search Console on launch day
- After any structural change (new page, URL change, redirect), update and resubmit sitemap

### Google Search Console — launch (run within 24 hours of going live)
- [ ] Verify ownership (DNS TXT record via Cloudflare — easiest method)
- [ ] Submit XML sitemap
- [ ] Run URL Inspection on the 3–5 most important pages → confirm "URL is on Google" or request indexing
- [ ] Check Coverage report for any immediate errors (redirect issues, blocked by robots.txt)
- [ ] Confirm canonical URLs are resolved correctly in URL Inspection
- [ ] Set preferred domain (www vs non-www) in GSC settings

### Google Search Console — ongoing (monthly)
- Check Coverage report: watch for new "Détectée — non indexée" or "Explorée — non indexée" entries
- Check Core Web Vitals report: flag any pages below "Good" threshold
- Check Performance report: identify pages with impressions but 0 clicks (title/meta needs work)
- Never request re-indexing without first fixing the underlying problem — it wastes the daily quota (10–15 requests/day) and delays Google's reassessment

### Backlinks — minimum viable authority for new domains
A brand new `.ma` domain has near-zero crawl priority. Even 3–5 quality backlinks at launch dramatically improve indexation speed. For every client site:
- Google Business Profile (links back to the site — mandatory)
- 2–3 local Moroccan directories relevant to their profession
- Client's social profiles (LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook) — link to the site in bio
- If a professional association exists (.ma domain), pursue a listing

### What NOT to do (common mistakes)
- ❌ Never create 20+ pages for a 3-service solo professional
- ❌ Never submit the sitemap before fixing redirect errors
- ❌ Never request indexing for a page with thin content — fix first, request after
- ❌ Never publish pages with near-identical content (e.g. "cabinet dentaire Casablanca" and "dentiste Casablanca" as two separate pages — merge them)
- ❌ Never create a page per métier × ville combination (e.g. "SEO dentistes Casablanca" + "SEO dentistes Rabat" + "SEO avocats Casablanca" + …) — pick one dimension only (city OR métier), never both multiplied
- ❌ Never ignore GSC for weeks after launch — check at day 3, day 7, day 30

## 9. Lessons from dryousra.ma Audit

> dryousra.ma was audited in May 2026. Strong homepage and service pages. Indexation issues traced to specific, avoidable mistakes. These are the takeaways — apply to every future site.

### ✅ What worked — replicate this
- Homepage copy: clear value proposition, real credibility signals (social proof, credentials, stats), strong CTAs
- Service pages: good depth, structured content (zones traitées, déroulement, FAQ, cross-links), proper title tags with location keywords
- Meta descriptions: written, specific, keyword-aware
- Canonical tags: present on every page
- CTA pattern: WhatsApp + click-to-call — correct for Moroccan market

### ❌ Mistake 1 — Thin "intent" navigation pages
dryousra.ma had 8 "besoins" pages (rajeunir, lèvres, rides, taches, etc.) each with ~120 words, a bullet list, 2 FAQ entries, and a CTA. Google crawled them, found near-zero unique value vs the service pages they linked to, and marked them all "Détectée — non indexée." These 8 thin pages dragged down the entire domain's quality signal.

**Rule going forward:**
- Navigation/aggregator pages (grouping by intent, symptom, or category) are useful for UX but must either have 300+ words of real, unique content — OR be `noindex`ed
- Default decision: `noindex` aggregator pages unless you're writing them properly
- Never create a page just to link to other pages — that's what the nav and internal links are for
- In Astro: add `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">` via the SEO component on any page that serves navigation purposes only

### ❌ Mistake 2 — Canonical / URL extension mismatch
The canonical tag declared `https://dryousra.ma/soins/injections/botox` (no extension) but the actual served URL was `https://dryousra.ma/soins/injections/botox.html`. Google sees two versions of every page, has to pick one, and logs redirect errors in GSC.

**Rule going forward:**
- Astro outputs clean URLs by default (`/botox` not `/botox.html`) — never override this
- The canonical tag must exactly match the URL Google will actually land on
- Verify canonical = actual URL on every page before launch using GSC URL Inspection tool
- Never mix `.html` extension URLs with clean URLs on the same site

### ❌ Mistake 3 — Too many pages for the site's authority
32 pages on a brand new `.ma` domain with limited backlinks = Google spreads its crawl budget thin and deprioritizes low-signal pages. The site would have indexed faster and more completely with 10 well-crafted pages at launch, and besoins/secondary pages added later once the domain had authority.

**Rule going forward:**
- Launch with the minimum viable page set (5–8 pages for showcase sites)
- Add secondary pages only after core pages are indexed and the domain has traction
- Never launch 30+ pages on a new domain — even if the content exists

## 10. Technical Principles

> Strategic principles (positioning, market philosophy, anti-models) are in `ATLASEO_strategy.md` §9. This section covers technical/methodological principles only.

- **No over-engineering**: if static works, use static. No DB if not needed. No SSR if static suffices.
- **One Worker per site**: self-contained, easy client handoff. Never share infrastructure between client projects.
- **Template first, customize second**: never build from scratch after v1. If a new requirement can't be met by the template, the template gets updated, then the project inherits.
- **SEO is not an afterthought**: schema, sitemap, GBP setup are part of every delivery, not optional upgrades.
- **Mobile-first**: 85% of Moroccan traffic is mobile. Test on real devices, not just DevTools.
- **WhatsApp is a primary conversion channel in Morocco**: always include it as a CTA, prominent on mobile.
- **Process emerges from building, not from planning**: document as you go. Update this file and the launch checklist whenever a new lesson appears.
